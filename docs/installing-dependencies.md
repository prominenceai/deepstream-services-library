# Installing DSL Dependencies
The DeepStream Services Library (DSL) is built on the NVIDA® [DeepStream SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk) and requires all SDK components to be installed and verified. The current Alpha version of DSL supports only the NVIDI® Jetson™ platform, and all development and testing to date has been purposely done on the Jetson Nano™, the smallest model with the most constraints on resources. Testing will be scalled up to the bigger models before releasing v1.0.

Please consult the [NVIDIA DeepStream Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/index.html) for complete Installation Instructions.

## Apache Runtime
The Apache Runtime is used by the GStreamer Window Sink requiring the following libraries to be installed
```
sudo apt-get install libapr1 libapr1-dev libaprutil1 libaprutil1-dev`
```

## Geometry Engine, Open Source (GEOS)
DSL uses the [GEOS](https://trac.osgeo.org/geos) C Library `libgeos-dev` - specifically, a set of spacial predicate functions for determining if geometries - points, lines, polygons - touch, cross, ovelap, etc. The following commands are used to install the library.
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libgeos-dev 
```

## Optional Documentation and Debug Dependencies
Doxygen is used for source documentation and can be generated by the following make command
```
$ make dox
```

### Installing dot by graphviz
Doxygen requires **dot** to convert calling graphs to .png files and Pipeline graphs can be generated using **dot** as well
```
$ sudo apt-get install graphviz imagemagick
```

### Installing Doxygen
To install Doxygen on Ubuntu
```
$ sudo apt-get install doxygen
```
